Is React.js Library or Framework
    React is not a Framework. React is now a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces.
    It is also know as ReactJS and React.js, so don't get cobnfused if you read different notation in different places.
    React knows only one think that is to create an awesome UI.

React is all about Component
    React.js application is just tree of such Component.

React is declarative or Imperative
    React is declarative because it describes what the UI should look like rather than how to achieve it. This makes
    the code easier to read and maintain, as it is more focused on the end result rather than the steps involved in
    getting there.

How React Works
    Component => Instance => React Elemrnts => Dom Element => UI

Why React.js Over Vanilla JavaScript
    Oppose to Vanilla JavaScript, React has a concept called COMPONENTS which combines all HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    by features instead of separating HTML, CSS and JavaScript completely.
    React manages updating the DOM (DOcument Object MOdel) with the components written by us.

Why React.js?
    React is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Component based Architecture
    Declarative UI
    Rich Ecosystem - npm packages
    Strong Community Support - Online/ Github
