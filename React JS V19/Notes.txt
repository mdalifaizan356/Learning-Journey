Is React.js Library or Framework
    React is not a Framework. React is now a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces.
    It is also know as ReactJS and React.js, so don't get cobnfused if you read different notation in different places.
    React knows only one think that is to create an awesome UI.

React is all about Component
    React.js application is just tree of such Component.

Why React.js?
    React is declarative because it describes what the UI should look like rather than how to achieve it. This makes
    the code easier to read and maintain, as it is more focused on the end result rather than the steps involved in
    getting there.
