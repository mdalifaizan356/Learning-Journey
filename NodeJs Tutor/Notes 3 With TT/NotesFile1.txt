What is REPL?
    The REPL of node is very useful in experimenting with node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.
    It is JavaScript command prompt.
    
    Read: Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
    Eval: Takes and evaluates the data structure.
    P: Prints the result.
    L: Loops the above command until the user parses ctrl-c twice.

    Go to REPL environment use command or type in terminal => node.
    Press tab 2 times for get all core module information.


Node.js Core Modules
    Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript Libraries, A set of functions you want to include in your application.
    Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.

    In Node.ja every individual file known as module. or har file k code ka scope private hota he jis wajah se hum us
    file k code ko kisi dusri file me access nahi kar sakte. Iske liye hme code ka scope public karna hota he exports 
    ki help se.

fs core module 
    writeFileSync method ka use karne pr agar file exist nahi karti he to file create karne k baad data store kar deta he.
    but agar file exist karti he to data ko completely delete kar deta he or new data k sath replace ya overwrite kar 
    deta he.

    appendFileSync method ka use karne pr data delete nahi hota he or previous data k sath new data add ho jata he.

    readFileSync method use kar k file ko read kiya jata he. or ye data ko buffer formate me return karta he.

    Node.js includes additional data type called Buffer. It is not available in browser's JavaScript.
    Buffer is mainly used to store binary data.
    While reading from a file or receiving packets over the network.

    Sync and Async CRUD operation using fs module.
        Create a folder named it myData.
        Create a file in it named bio.txt and add data into it.
        Add more data into the file at the end of the existing data.
        Read data without getting the buffer data at first using file encoding
        Rename the file name to mybio.txt.
        Now delete both file and folder.


Os Module
    OS module user system k os ki informartion ko collect karta he.

Path Modules
    Validation me ye check karna he k specific file type upload ho waha iska use ho sakta he.
    Ya kisi file ka root directory pata karna ho kisi file ka path pata karna ho to iska use ho sakta he.
