Projection:
    syntax:
            db.collactionName.find({},{field1:1, field2:1})
    
    To include specific fields, use projection with a value of 1 for the fields we want.

    To exclude fields, use projection with a value of 0 for the fields we want to exclude.

    We cannot include and exclude fields simultaneously in the same query projection but _id is
    exception.


Embedded Documents:
    Query documents inside embedded documents using dot notation.

    syntax:
            db.collactionName.find({"Parent.child":value})
