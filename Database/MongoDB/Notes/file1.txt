MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented NoSql database management system.

Document-Oriented database also known as Document database or a document store. It is store data
and information in document.

It is designed for flexibility, Scalability and performance in handling Unstructured or
Semi-Structured data.

It was created by a company called 10gen. Which is now known as MongoDB,inc. The company was
founded by Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman in 2007. The first version of MongoDB was released
in 2009.

HUMONGOUS k name se mongo name pdha he.

SQL vs MongoDB:
SQL:
    SQL database are relational databases.
    They use structured tables to store data in rows and columns.
    Suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and fixed data structures.
    Eg: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

MongoDB
        NoSQL database are non-relational databases.
        They Provide flexibility in data-storage, allowing varied data types and structures.
        Ideal for application with dynamic or evolving data models.
        CMS, Social Media Platforms, Gaming.
        Eg: MongoDB, Cassandra etc...

Structured data: Limited Feilds k sath data store hota he means that SQL me tables bani rehti he
usme database ka structure predefine ho jata he ya kar diya jata he with data type. or jab kabhi data insert karna hota
he tb Feilds k according hi data insert hota he. 

Untructured data : Isme table ka concept to he hi nahi. isme kisi particular collection k liye
documents me data store hotan he jaha pr documents ka structure predefine nahi rehta he jiski
wajah se hum kisi bhi ducument me feilds or key kam or zyada ho sakti he ise hi flexibility 
kaha jata he. Yaha document scemaless hota he.

MongoDB Terminologies:

Database: 
        collection1                 collection2                 collection3
            document1           document1   document2       document1   document2   document3



Key Features of MongoDB
1. Flexibility schema Design:
                              MongoDB allows dynamic,schema-less data structures.
                              Easily accommodate changing data requirments.

2. Scalability and performance:
                                Horizontal scaling supports large datasets and high traffic.
                                Optimized read and write operations for fast performance.

3. Document-Oriented storage:
                              Data is stored in flexible, JSON like BSON documents.
                              Self-contained units with rich data types and nested arrays.

4. Daynamic Queries:
                     Rich query language with support for comlex queries.
                     Utilize indexes to speed up query execution.

5. Aggregation Framework:
                          Perform advanced data transformations and analysis.
                          Process data using multiple pipeline stages.

6.Open Source and Community:
                            MongoDB is open-source with a vibrant community.
                            Regular updates, improvements and support.


How MongoDB works:
                Jab Koi user frontend side se request karta he to backend me chal rha node js
                mongoDB server ko request transfer karta he. MongoDB server direct database se
                communicate nahi karta he. MongoDB server me storage engine hota he jise
                wiredTiger k name se jana jata he. Ye storage engine database me rakhi files or
                data ko read and write karta he.  Yhi storage engine data ko JSON se BSON me
                convert kar k data ko store karta he.

JSON Vs BSON(Binary Json):
In mongoDB, we write in JSON formate only but behind the scene data is stored in BSON
(Binary Json)formate, A Binary representation of JSON.

By utilizing BSON, MongoDB can achieve higher read and write speeds, reduced storage requirments,
and improved data manipulation capabilities, making it well-suited for handling large and complex
datasets while maintainig performance efficiency.

Installation:
            MongoDB : Provide server
            mongo shell: For use to run mongodb command.
